EEG wavelet preprocessing add to eeg data preprocessor
    already done?: decorrelation
Finish EEG trainer: copy meg trainer
Almost there: Eventually generalize the training pipeline so you can run diff tasks (i.e binary classification, simple multiclass, MEG vs EEG vs Generation)
Implement generative model
